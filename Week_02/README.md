## Update your README.md with a brief explanation of how virtual detectors allow post-acquisition imaging:

Answer: Virtual detectors computationally select regions of each diffraction pattern in a 4D-STEM dataset and integrate the intensity within these regions for every scan position. This transforms the diffraction information into real-space images with specific contrast—such as bright-field for diffraction/density or annular dark-field for Z-contrast—allowing multiple imaging modes to be generated after acquisition without moving physical detectors.
