# Week 2: Core Tools for Microscopy Data Analysis
January 12-16, 2026

## Overview
This week focuses on understanding multidimensional data structures in electron microscopy, with particular emphasis on 4D-STEM data. Students will learn to distinguish between navigation and signal axes, work with 4D datasets, and implement virtual detector reconstructions.

## Monday: Introduction to 4D-STEM Data Structures
- Distinguishing Navigation vs. Signal Axes
- Loading and calibrating 4D-STEM datasets
- Basic data inspection and metadata handling

## Wednesday: Virtual Detectors and Post-Acquisition Imaging

## Key Concepts
- **Navigation Axes**: Spatial coordinates where measurements are made (x, y scan positions)
- **Signal Axes**: Data measured at each navigation point (diffraction patterns, spectra)
- **Virtual Detectors**: Post-acquisition image formation from diffraction data
- **Bragg Calibration**: Using crystallographic reflections for precise detector calibration
- **Reference Materials**: Au nanoparticles, Si, MoS₂ (well-characterized standards)
- **Reciprocal Space**: Calibration in units of 1/nm for diffraction patterns
- **4D-STEM**: Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy data

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, students should be able to:
1. Explain the difference between navigation and signal axes in multidimensional data
2. Load and calibrate 4D-STEM datasets using py4DSTEM
3. Implement virtual detector reconstructions (BF, ADF)
4. Create publication-quality visualizations of microscopy data
5. Understand how virtual detectors enable flexible post-acquisition imaging
6. Use Bragg reflections for precise detector and reciprocal-space calibration
7. Validate calibration using reference materials (Au nanoparticles)
8. Apply best practices for reproducible and documented calibration workflows

## Update your README.md with a brief explanation of how virtual detectors allow post-acquisition imaging:

Answer: Virtual detectors computationally select regions of each diffraction pattern in a 4D-STEM dataset and integrate the intensity within these regions for every scan position. This transforms the diffraction information into real-space images with specific contrast—such as bright-field for diffraction/density or annular dark-field for Z-contrast—allowing multiple imaging modes to be generated after acquisition without moving physical detectors.
